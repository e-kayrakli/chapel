bug: Enums with explicit types and offsets fail to cast correctly

Enums with explicit element types and an offset (not starting at 1) do not
account for the offset during a value -> enum cast.

Furthermore, the error message for many of these compilation errors points to
the enum declaration rather than the enum cast line, which is not entirely
helpful.

This issue exposes a bug in the "working" case from #5412.
