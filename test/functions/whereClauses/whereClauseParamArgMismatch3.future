bug: where clauses on generic functions are evaluated too early

Where clauses should be a filter in selecting functions only if the
actuals would work for the formals.  In cases like this where the
function call isn't valid without the where clause, we should never
evalute the where clause.  For some reason, when we're evaluating
generic functions today, we evaluate their where clauses before we
make sure their arguments match.  In this case the function does not
_seem_ generic (in that it's well-typed), but is due to its param
argument.  So the open question is: "Do we really need to make this
early call to evluate the where clause?  And if so, why?"
