# Skip test chplvis3 when running multinode multilocale tests on chapcs cluster

# When chplvis3 tries to run multinode multilocale on the chapcs cluster
# during the nightly builds, Slurm will block almost everything else while
# it waits for 8 nodes to become available.

# (chplvis3 wants 8 nodes, but chapcs cluster only has 11 "compute" nodes)
