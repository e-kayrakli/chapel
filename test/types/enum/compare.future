bug: Comparing an enum element to a value results in compiler error


Comparing an enum element to a value results in the following `==` overload
resolving:

   inline proc ==(param a: int(?w), param b: int(w)) param return __primitive("==", a, b);

Which triggers the following error in postFold.cpp:

   USR_FATAL_CONT(call, "'param' functions cannot return non-'param' values");

This particular error propagates to several other operations on enums,
including % (modulus), which is how this error was surfaced.
