bug: Enums with explicit types fail to cast correctly

Casting an enum element with explicit element types to the element type results
in a compilation error in some cases.

The error is from type.cpp:

    // We think that all params should have init values by now.
    INT_ASSERT(sym && !sym->symbol()->hasFlag(FLAG_PARAM));

Interestingly, this snippet, which has a slightly altered code path, succeeds
in compiling and executing as expected:

    type t = int(64);
    enum Numbers {one=1:t, two};
    writeln(Numbers.one: t); // prints '1'
